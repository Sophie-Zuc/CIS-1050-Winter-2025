        <h1 class="paragraph">Who are the characters?</h1>

        <!--- This section contains the heading, image and paragraph about the first character --->

        <h2 class="subheading">Kirby</h2>

        <img class="characterKirby" src="KirbyCharacter.png" alt="A picture of Kirby from Kirby's Return to Dream Land">

        <p class="content">
          The protagonist of the games, <span class="emphasis">Kirby</span> is a cheerful pink puff that is always willing to help others in need! He has a spherical body, short little arms, red shoes, blue eyes, and a big smile. He is characterized by his childlike innocence and his love of food. His favourite snacks are Maxim Tomatoes, which are the best healing items in the games and bring the player back up to full health. His species is unknown, but his body is soft and flexible, allowing him to swallow different objects and inflate himself with air to fly. Though commonly referred to with masculine pronouns, his actual gender is also unspecified.

        <!--- This section contains the heading, image and paragraph about the second character --->

        <h2 class="subheading">King Dedede</h2>

        <img class="character" src="KingDededeCharacter.png" alt="A picture of King Dedede from Kirby's Return to Dream Land">

        <p class="content">
          Kirby’s main rival, <span class="emphasis">King Dedede</span> is a large blue penguin-like creature and the self-proclaimed ruler of Dream Land. He wields a massive hammer, and commands an army of Waddle Dees. He has a large ego and is very gluttonous, once stealing all the food in the kingdom in <a class="normal" href="https://wikirby.com/wiki/Kirby%27s_Dream_Land" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Kirby’s Dream Land</em></a>. However, he is not necessarily an evil character. Over time, his relationship with Kirby shifts from archenemies to friendly rivals. They even work together in several games, especially when a greater threat emerges. Interestingly, he is the only character besides Kirby to have starred in his own game: the spin-off <a class="normal" href="https://wikirby.com/wiki/Dedede%27s_Drum_Dash_Deluxe" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Dedede's Drum Dash Deluxe</em></a>.
        </p>

        <!--- This section contains the heading, image and paragraph about the third character --->

        <h2 class="subheading">Meta Knight</h2>

        <img class="characterMetaKnight" src="MetaKnightCharacter.png" alt="A picture of Meta Knight from Kirby's Return to Dream Land">

        <p class="content">
          <span class="emphasis">Meta Knight</span> is a mysterious masked swordsman with an unknown backstory. He is usually a rival to Kirby that appears in boss battles, but he has also teamed up with the pink protagonist to fight by his side. Meta Knight is very skilled with his sword, the Galaxia, and is very quick and difficult to hit, flying rapidly with his wings. He owns a giant warship called the Halberd. He always hides his face with a mask, but in the few instances we see his true form, he strongly resembles Kirby. He has a strong moral code, always offering Kirby a sword before they fight.

        <!--- This section contains the heading, image and paragraph about the fourth character --->

        <h2 class="subheading">Waddle Dee</h2>

        <img class="character" src="WaddleDeeCharacter.png" alt="A picture of Bandana Waddle Dee from Kirby's Return to Dream Land">

        <p class="content">
          <span class="emphasis">Waddle Dees</span> are some of the most common creatures in Dream Land. They appear in some capacity in every Kirby game. They have small orange bodies, yellow shoes, and no mouths. They aren’t very strong, and are mostly passive and neutral characters. They have appeared as both enemies and friendly NPCs. King Dedede has an army of Waddle Dees under his command. One specific Waddle Dee, called <span class="emphasis">Bandana Waddle Dee</span>, is a playable character in games such as <a class="normal" href="https://wikirby.com/wiki/Kirby_and_the_Forgotten_Land" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Kirby and the Forgotten Land</em></a> and <a class="normal" href="https://wikirby.com/wiki/Kirby%27s_Return_to_Dream_Land" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Kirby’s Return to Dream Land</em></a>. He wears a blue bandana and wields a spear, assisting Kirby during their adventures.
