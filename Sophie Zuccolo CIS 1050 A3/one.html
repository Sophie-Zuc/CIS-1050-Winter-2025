        <p class="content">
          The first game in the series, <a class="normal" href="https://wikirby.com/wiki/Kirby%27s_Dream_Land" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Kirby’s Dream Land</em></a> was released in 1992 for the Game Boy. It is notably the first game that Masahiro Sakurai ever developed. The plot begins when King Dedede and his minions steal the magical Sparkling Stars and all the food in Dream Land. The game follows Kirby’s quest to retrieve the Sparkling Stars and return the food to the people of Dream Land. The game is a simple side-scrolling action platformer, and is relatively short, consisting of only five levels. It established many of the key design conventions that would continue throughout the series, such as Kirby’s ability to fly and inhale enemies and objects. However, Copy Abilities hadn’t been introduced yet.

        <p class="content">
          <a class="normal" href="https://wikirby.com/wiki/Kirby%27s_Adventure" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Kirby’s Adventure</em></a>, the second game in the series, came out a year after the first in 1993. It was made for the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES), making it the first Kirby game for home consoles. It was the first in the series to feature Copy Abilities, where Kirby can gain special powers from eating certain enemies. The game was also the first to be in colour, meaning it is Kirby’s first in-game appearance being pink. <em>Kirby’s Adventure</em> expanded on the ideas of the first game, with improved graphics that pushed the limits of the hardware. The game follows Kirby’s travels across Dream Land to collect the pieces of the Star Rod and repair it after King Dedede breaks it apart. However, King Dedede is not the true villain of the game. The real threat is an evil entity called Nightmare—King Dedede hid the pieces of the Star Rod in an attempt to prevent it from falling into his hands. This is the first game in the series where the final boss is a cosmic horror-type threat, which is a trend that continues throughout the franchise.

        <p class="content">
          <a class="normal" href="https://wikirby.com/wiki/Kirby_Super_Star" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Kirby Super Star</em></a> was released for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System (SNES) in 1996. It is composed of seven separate games and two sub-games. The primary games are:
        </p>
        <ul class="content">
          <li><em>Spring Breeze</em></li>
          <li><em>Dyna Blade</em></li>
          <li><em>Gourmet Race</em></li>
          <li><em>The Great Cave Offensive</em></li>
          <li><em>Revenge of Meta Knight</em></li>
          <li><em>Milky Way Wishes</em></li>
          <li><em>The Arena</em></li>
        </ul>
        <p class="content">
          The two sub-games are <em>Samurai Kirby</em> and <em>Megaton Punch</em>. While most of these smaller games keep the same mechanics, they have different stories and objectives. <em>Kirby Super Star</em> was the first main-line Kirby game to feature multiplayer. This game also introduced the Helper system, which allowed Kirby to transform his currently equipped Copy Ability into the creature with that ability, who will then help Kirby fight. The Helper is controlled automatically by default, but a second player can join in and play as the Helper too. <em>Kirby Super Star</em> is notable for including a remake of the first Kirby game, <em>Kirby’s Dream Land</em>. It is called <em>Spring Breeze</em>, and is a shortened version of the game with improved visuals thanks to the system’s more powerful hardware.

        <p class="content">
          Released on the Nintendo 64 in 2000, <a class="normal" href="https://wikirby.com/wiki/Kirby_64:_The_Crystal_Shards" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Kirby 64: The Crystal Shards</em></a> follows Kirby’s quest to reassemble a sacred crystal shattered by the villain Dark Matter. It is the first game in the series for the Nintendo 64, and is most notable for being the first to feature 3D graphics. It is still a side-scrolling action-platformer, but features the unique gameplay gimmick of Power Combos, where two Copy Abilities can be combined to make a new compound ability. This feature allowed for so many creative new ideas! For example, Ice and Spark can be combined to turn Kirby into a refrigerator that generates healing food, or Fire and Stone to let him shoot burning rocks at enemies like a volcano. <em>Kirby 64</em> was also the first game in the series to feature King Dedede as a playable character.

        <p class="content">
          <a class="normal" href="https://wikirby.com/wiki/Kirby%27s_Epic_Yarn" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Kirby's Epic Yarn</em></a> was the first game in the franchise for the Wii, and was a departure from the traditional formula in many ways. Released in 2010, the game began as an original project called <em>Fluff of Yarn</em> by the Japanese game development company Good-Feel. In collaboration with Nintendo, the protagonist was later changed to be Kirby. After crossing the game’s antagonist Yin Yarn in an attempt to have a snack, Kirby is transformed into yarn and sent to Patch Land, a world made completely out of cloth, yarn and other craft materials. This gives the title a distinct visual style unlike any other game in the series. He agrees to help Prince Fluff, the leader of Patch Land, collect pieces of the Magic Yarn to stitch the world back together and stop Yin Yarn. Kirby has completely different abilities in this game: he is no longer able to swallow enemies or fly. Instead, his moveset is based around gaining the ability to transform into other objects, like a car or a parachute. According to <a class="normal" href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/kirbys-epic-yarn/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Metacritic</em></a>, <em>Kirby’s Epic Yarn</em> is one of the most acclaimed games in the series, and it is my personal favourite. It gives me a sense of peace and calm, which is in large part thanks to the incredible soundtrack composed by Tomoya Tomita. Good-Feel would later go on to work on the title <a class="normal" href="https://www.mariowiki.com/Yoshi%27s_Woolly_World" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Yoshi’s Woolly World</em></a>, which is a spiritual successor to <em>Kirby’s Epic Yarn</em>.

        <p class="content">
          Coming out on the Nintendo Switch in 2022, <a class="normal" href="https://wikirby.com/wiki/Kirby_and_the_Forgotten_Land" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Kirby and the Forgotten Land</em></a> is the first true 3D platformer in the history of the series. It has since become the highest grossing Kirby game of all time. According to <a class="normal" href="https://wikirby.com/wiki/Kirby_and_the_Forgotten_Land" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>WiKirby</em></a>, <em>Forgotten Land</em> sold 7.52 million copies as of March 2024, surpassing the original <em>Kirby's Dream Land</em> and its 5.13 million copies sold. It is the most recent original entry in the main-line series, and many believe it to be the best in the franchise. Kirby and the inhabitants of Planet Popstar are sucked into a dark vortex that appears suddenly over Dream Land. They land on an unknown planet that contains the remnants of an abandoned civilization, and Kirby discovers that the Waddle Dees have been kidnapped by the formidable Beast Pack, creatures native to the planet. He sets out to rescue them with the help of Elfilin, a friendly, unassuming creature with a shocking backstory. A second player can join in as Bandana Waddle Dee, who can fight with many different spear attacks. The game also features the new Mouthful Mode, where Kirby can swallow and control large objects like cars and traffic cones to fight enemies and solve puzzles.
